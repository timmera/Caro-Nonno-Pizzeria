Eggs. Eggs make up the bulk of the pancakes. It’s best to use room temp eggs.
Sugar. Sugar adds sweetness. If you don’t want to use sugar and make keto soufflé pancakes, you can substitute in something like Swerve for a sugar-free alternative.
Milk. Milk helps smooth out the pancake batter.
Flour. You need just the tiniest amount of flour to help your pancakes hold their shape. If you want to make keto soufflé pancakes, use superfine almond flour.
Baking powder. Baking powder is what makes the pancakes rise tall and fluffy.
Cream of tartar. Cream of tartar is a stabilizer that will help your egg whites whip up to their potential. Stable fluffy egg whites are the key to successfully making soufflé pancakes. If you don’t have cream of tartar, you can sub in 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice.
