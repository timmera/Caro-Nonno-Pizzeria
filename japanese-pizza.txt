Bread. Japanese milk bread or shokupan is ideal, but you can make pizza toast on any bread. If I don’t have any milk bread, I prefer a nice fluffy soft white bread. Sometimes I cut the crusts off.
Pizza sauce. Go ahead and use your favorite pizza sauce. If you don’t have any pizza sauce on hand, you can simmer a bit of crushed tomatoes with garlic powder and oregano, the oregano will make it taste just like pizza sauce.
Pizza toppings. Here’s where you can get creative! I went with classic toppings: pepperoni, onions, and green peppers. You can do ham and cheese, pineapple (I love pineapple on pizza), mushrooms, caramelized onions, basil, broccoli, roasted potatoes, meatballs…I could go on and on.
Cheesey. Of course cheese pull mozzarella is a fave and what I used but again, you can use whatever stretchy cheese you like: provolone, cheddar, pepper jack, fontina, gruyere, or even brie or burrata!
