Rice paper – this is the base of our pizza. When you grill it it gets crispy and crunchy. It’s important that when you buy your rice paper, it’s 100% rice. North American rice papers tends to contain tapioca flour because it makes it super easy to roll without tearing. Tapioca doesn’t crisp up in the same way as rice paper does, so make sure you get rice paper that only has rice listed in the ingredients.
Egg – instead of tomato sauce, Vietnamese pizza uses egg as a sauce/binder. The egg helps the toppings stick to the rice paper and prevents the rice paper from toasting too much. It also hydrates the rice paper a bit and contributes to the crispy chewy texture. In Vietnamese they tend to use quail eggs, I went with just regular eggs just because of ease.
Toppings – here is where people get inventive. Classic street food offerings include green onions, dried shrimp, pork floss (crispy sweet-n-savory dried pork bits), sausages, corn, canned tuna, ham, crispy shallots, lemongrass,
cheese – especially Laughing Cow cheese.
Sauces – sriracha, Kewpie mayo, sweet chili sauce, hoisin, anything your heart desires. Usually you’ll see sweet chili sauce or sriracha and Kewpie mayo.
